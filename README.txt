Christmas Assignment

The object of the game is to "consume" as many small dots as possible.
Touching the red dot will kill you. 
When you consume the edible dots, you (the player) will increase in size slowly.
When you reach a certain size, you need to consume more to grow.
After consuming 100 small dots, you are on the next level.

There are 3 levels.

As you move onto levels, there are more red dots created that can kill you, and less edible dots that make you grow in size.

You can restart your game if you lose or go back to the menu.
There are instructions for you to read.

** I did not use keypress in my game, as I prefer the player to follow my mouse. I also suck at using keypress so it was difficult to test my game :)
